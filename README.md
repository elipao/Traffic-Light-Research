In order to run this traffic like simulator software, you need the following files: 

Support Files: 
- light_control.py: contains functions to control the LEDs on the PiTraffic Traffic Light with various light modes. 
- matrix_control.py: contains basic functionality and access to the CrowPi Matrix LED Display for written messages. 
- sound_control.py: contains functionality and access to buzzer on the CrowPi. 
Main Driver File: 
- proto_5.py: the driver code which uses all support files and behaves as a finite state machine. 

Instructions: 
Run driver.py and enter in the amount of time you would like the simulation to run for. Press the red button on the PiTraffic shield to 
initiate emergency vehicle situation!
